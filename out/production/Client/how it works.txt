Setup {
Main in GameController ->
- new GameController
- new ClientGUI("title", gameController)
GUI ->
- sets basic Frame settings / server settings
- starts setListeners();
    -> new listeners
- starts buildGUI();
    -> builds all gui panels in their own methods
        -> new GridBuilders(gameController, 'isPlayer' true)
            -> Calls super() / extends Grid
                -> makes grid of JPanels with Parents getCell() method
            - assigns mouseListener to each cell
                -> finds pointer location of cell and the next 2 beside it
                // todo add this to find the setting of which ship it's placing
                // todo because currently it's making ships of 3 rn / on x axis
            - adds ship to player [ gameController.getPlayer().addShip(coordinates) ]
                -> in Player.addShip(ArrayList<Coordinate> coordinates)
                    - checks for edge or not
                    - checks if space is taken by another ship
                    - checks if < 5 ships
                    - adds to fleet (ArrayList<Ship> fleet)
                    - removes ship type option from gui
- starts ConnectToServer();
    -> sets up connection to server
    -> asks server if it's this players turn or not
    -> server responds based on who asks first
